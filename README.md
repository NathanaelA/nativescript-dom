We have an awesome, new service in town!   This service provides tested new and upgraded plugins.  All ProPlugins are already known to work with NativeScript 6.x.
If you are interested in getting the latest, known working, and enhanced plugins; check out https://ProPlugins.org -- because I strongly believe in what ProPlugins offers the community all of my development work is being done on the ProPlugins version.

Please feel free to continue to use this version of the plugin, it is now 100% being maintained by **YOU** the community, and as such
I will gladly continue to support the community version by accepting any/all PR's for this plugin and publish it.  I will attempt to verify the PR doesn't have any backdoors; but I won't be doing any testing, so if it is broken it is up to you to send a PR!


## Documentation
The [documentation](src/README.md) for the plugin is located in the [src folder](src).
